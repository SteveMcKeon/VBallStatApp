#New Features
add "export highlights" (for player / action type) functionality, ffmpeg
Add functionailty for users to add stats so I don't have to do it all myself (this will require automating the rally/seq/touch/score, perhaps even timestamp numbering).
	-add "insert rows" here/at end, copy/paste row, tab/enter switching to right/down editable cells.
Add video player settings option to change settings such as "jump forward/backward" timings, delay after end of rally before skipping to next rally during autoplay
	-Possible fix required. If time is increased too much it messes with all my timing stuff on autplay/rally seek...
Add video upload functionaility
	-Automate encoding pipeline.
Add tooltip intro for new users to introduce features.
Add "stat editor" user role
Add resize video option (drag) in side-by-side mode.
Make certian cells drop selectable only good values (points won, etc.) on admin insert
Show timestamp on video seekbar as you scrub
After I scrub, seek doesn't work right? it's going frame by frame. Add frame seek with "<" and ">" (in reality "," and ".")
	Shift + -> and <- for seek to set.
	Shift + n for next video (by date).
Re add Header animation to disappear on scroll, and to work for mobile(add to app.jsx)
Resize table columns button?
Add green/yellow/red icons for status of videos on video selector.
Add contact / bug report / suggestions email?
OAuth -> register team, invite other players / accounts to team.
Make it so, when autoplay or highlights is on, seeking with left/right seeks into the timings of the rally/highlights

#Fixes
REFACTOR
Clicking into a second editablecell immediately exits.
Zoom scrub should not highlight.
make select a game not selectable after you select so keys dont mess with it.
sometimes selecting a new game doesn't allow the rallytimes to work correctly?
When selecting a cell to edit, it's auto filling the filtered somehow, but only the first time I try to edit. if I escape and then reenter, it works.
